# Text Analysis with Multinomial Naive Bayes

In this project, we are trying to classify the 'freshness' of critics for movies. 

The basic techniques are shown in action, such as CountVectorizer to create a bag of words for each critic (document). Then we group the critics into target groups: 'fresh' and 'rotten'.

All the work is compiled in a Jupyter notebook.
